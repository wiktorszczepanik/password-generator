## Password Generator
The Password Generator is a Java library designed to create random passwords with flexible rules and customization options. It allows you to specify the length of the password, set length ranges, and define the percentage distribution of character types (upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters).
### Getting Started
To get started, create an instance of the **PasswordGenerator**.
```Java
PasswordGenerator password = new PasswordGenerator();
```
